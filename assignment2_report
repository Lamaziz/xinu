Ques 1: Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why? 
 -> No, our program does not produce any garbage value as output .

But if we are running "prodcons" command twice or more times without going out of 'qemu' then loops are 
running for "number of times they runned for last time + the count value set on new command) because "n" is a global variable and its value
is being added.

Ques 2:Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for a small count like 20.
->No,all the produced values are not getting consumed.

xsh $ prodcons 20
